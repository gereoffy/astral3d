Independent Astral Engine Release 2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is the latest (and possibly last) version of the Astral Demo Engine.
It works with all astral powerdemos (from alpha to haugyjobb).

What's better?
- many bugs (mostly card/driver incompatibilities) fixed
- some speed optimization (faster than party releases)
- windows version compiled with mingw32 (gcc) instead of Watcom C 11
- support color depth/resolution change

Usage:
  LINUX:  ./demo-lnx.elf [options] [scriptname]
  WINDOZE:  demo-win.exe [options] [scriptname]

Options:
  Color depth:  (default: current desktop depth)
  -16      force 16bpp  [WIN only]
  -24      force 24bpp  [WIN only]
  -32      force 32bpp  [WIN only]

  Resolution:   (under linux you MUST specify res. in fullscreen too!!!)
  -640     force 640x480 mode
  -800     force 800x600 mode
  -1024    force 1024x768 mode
  -1280    force 1280x1024 mode
  
  -fullscreen  or  -window  to chose display mode

  -nosound   disable music

Scriptname:  (default: astral.scr)
  Use scripts from this package for the demos, instead the original
  scripts shipped with them! It will NOT work with original scripts!!!
  You must copy & rename to astral.scr, or specify script path/name
  at the commandline!
  You find new script for every astral powerdemo in this package.

Where can I find OpenGL drivers for linux?
  See LiNUX-GL.FAQ in this package!
