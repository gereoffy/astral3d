   [history]

      Everything started in december of 1997. We were really bored with the
   team  called unicorn and we decided to create a new one. We wanted to be
   more active and show what we can do. On the 19th of december 1997 astral
   was born. The founders were: robson, inferno, towerx, magic, n0thingman.
      After the jumper97 party,  ren joined our team (da phun-man:).
   Sprite  joined  as  a tracer in january. Before the flag'98 party, we
   met icicle. He was our musician but he was kicked out, because he wasn't
   too  active. Our first demo was released at the scenest-rage party.
   We took the 5th place,  the design  and  the code wasn't as high quality
   as we  wanted,  but actually we don't care about it  'coz our next  demo
   will  be  a  real  kick-ass  one  ;)
   after two month of convincing finally  shaman  decided  joining astral.
   Edo left contract and became a member of astral. Strepto (was a coder of
   an old team) started his scene-life again and became an astral-trooper :)
   before antiq '98, and arpi joined  at the party (also a coder). Ren left
   our team, because he was  tired  of  scene.  Immortal rat in november
   settled to continue his great  scene activity with us. Magic was kicked
   out in november, because he was totally inactive. There is a new member
   again: phuture kemist (musician)...ohh..our group seems very large now :))
      The silence has broken up around astral and begun  to  work  on  the
   second demo called "friday". This demo will be never finished. :(
   We really want to compete with something at the contest99, so we created
   radikal in a few weeks.  It's a hi-res demo with some brand new effects.
   We took the 1th place, in spite of the design wasn't as good as we wanted.
      Unfortunately after contest two of the founders left the team:
   inferno moved to rhyme and robson joined to exceed. This time we thought
   that astral has died. Arpi joined to exceed as well, but didn't leave
   astral, he was still working on the radikal final version.  Then came
   strepto with some new effects, and they decided to make a big, hard-coded
   demo for mekka'99. Unfortunately it was not finished because the lack of
   gfx. Then astral members became inactive again...
      In august 99 strepto visited arpi and showed his new opengl 3D engine.
   It was a big change to make demo for 3D hardware. We spent weeks developing
   and optimizing the new engine, and then we decided to contribute to the
   power demo compo at Ragest'99 party in middle september. And we won... :)
   It was finished five minutes before show time! ...with lots of bug, but
   since then we released the final version. (We made a windows version too,
   because the party release was for linux!)
   A month later although Towerx told the coders not to hurry with new demos
   but Arpi and Strepto asked him for a music for the new demo. It happened a
   week before conference3000:) The demo was ready hours before the compo and
   "Beta" won the demo competition. After Conference3000 we wanted to make a
   hyper-mega demo with nice storyline for The Party but...u know - lack of 
   time. Our coders decided to make a "fast" accelated demo for Tp...
   We got the 3rd place at TheParty. It's good enough for first time.

   [future plans]
   To win power demo competition at every party :)
   ...but we need good 2D & 3D graphicians to achieve this.
